# dungeon-crawl
A fun dungeon crawl game played through your terminal

## Outline of Game
1. Welcome text - name your “hero” - Use this name for the rest of the time
2. Choose your “adventure” - you are looking for a key to get out, or a gem to bring back to a merchant, or a monsters head to your leader
3. Choose a path - right or left - maybe put some notes about each one… welcoming text explaining where you last were?
    - ex: you smell fire to the right, you see a slight light and hear groaning coming from the left
4. At the end of each “path” is a different “room” - the left path might be a room with a three headed dragon guarding the gem, the right path might be a fire to cook a chicken leg over to gain +5 health
5. From there each path is connected to another room, you can choose to go back the way you came or choose a new path you have never been - make a prompt telling the “hero” they are going back a path they already took? 
6. After “hero” chooses the right path for their adventure they will gain their prize
