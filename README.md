# dungeon-crawl
A fun dungeon crawl game played through your terminal

## Basic TODO
- [X] create a welcome prompt
- [X] have user be able to name their adventurer
- [] create REPL which allows adventurers to move N,E,S,W
- [X] create rooms and link them
- [] create player model


## Outline of Game
1. Welcome text - name your adventurer - Use this name for the rest of the time
2. *stretch* Choose your “adventure” - you are looking for a key to get out, or a gem to bring back to a merchant, or a monsters head to your leader
3. Choose a path - right or left - maybe put some notes about each one… welcoming text explaining where you last were?
    - ex: you smell fire to the right, you see a slight light and hear groaning coming from the left
4. At the end of each “path” is a different “room” - *stretch* the left path might be a room with a three headed dragon guarding the gem, the right path might be a fire to cook a chicken leg over to gain +5 health
5. From there each path is connected to another room, you can choose to go back the way you came or choose a new path you have never been - *stretch* make a prompt telling the adventurer they are going back a path they already took? 
6. After the adventurer chooses the right path for their adventure they will gain their prize
